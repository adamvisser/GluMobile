        Nginx, PHP7.2 PHP7.2-fpm, Composer, NPM, Node.js v8.x
    
-  **mysql**, MySQL database container ([mysql](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/) official Docker image)

#### **Directory Structure**

### **Setup instructions**

**Prerequisites:** 

* Depending on your OS, the appropriate version of Docker Community Edition has to be installed on your machine.  ([Download Docker Community Edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community))

**Installation steps:** 

1. Create a new directory in which your OS user has full read/write access and clone this repository inside.

2. Open a new terminal/CMD, navigate to this repository root (where `docker-compose.yml` exists) and execute the following command:

    ```
    $ docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This will download/build all the required images and start the stack containers. It usually takes a bit of time, so grab a cup of coffee.


3. That's it! Navigate to [http://localhost](http://localhost) to access the application.
